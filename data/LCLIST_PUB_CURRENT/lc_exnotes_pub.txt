        AKARI                          This note applies to all 'AKARI' details records. The Usui
                                       (2011) paper (AKARI/IRC Survey) used H values from Lowell
                                       Observatory's ASTORB file and assumed ± 0.05 mag error. In
                                       some cases, using the stated values for albedo and diameter
                                       in the standard formulae to compute H (see LCDB README) does
                                       not give the ASTORB value of H, usually differing by
                                       0.01-0.02 mag.


      2 Pallas                        
        Carry 2010a                    Density = 3.4 ± 0.9 g/cc.  Dimensions: a = 275 ± 4 km; b =
                                       258 ± 3 km; c = 238 ± 3 km.

        Durech 2011a                   This applies to all entries for Durech 2011a. All but 14 of
                                       the spin axis values in Durech 2011a are assumed values taken
                                       from the literature. See the original paper for specifics.

        Hanus 2017b                    Hanus 2017b is based on combining photometric, adaptive
                                       optics, and occulation observations.

        Pravec 2012b                   This note applies to all Pravec 2012b entries. In almost all
                                       cases, the original Pravec values were H_R. The H_V values
                                       were derived using assumed V-R values from various sources
                                       based on known taxonomic class or orbital position. If a
                                       diameter and albedo are given, these are revised values based
                                       on the original WISE H, G, D, and pV, corrected using the new
                                       H-G values and Harris and Harris (1997).

        Pal 2020                       This applies to all records from Pal 2019 Period and
                                       amplitude errors were not included in the original data set.
                                       During the mass import of their results table, the period
                                       error was set to five units of the last decimal place. The
                                       amplitude error was set to 20% of the reported amplitude. The
                                       errors are a general guide only and should not be considered
                                       valid for statisitcal studies unless after reviewing the
                                       original plots. These are available at:

        Durech 2009                    The pole (126, +40) agrees well with occultation profiles.

        Mainzer 2011                   The diameters and H values were taken from other sources and
                                       then used to calibrate expected errors in diameters and
                                       albedo derived from WISE data.

        Hanus 2013b                    Diameter is derived from AO-inversion model for preferred
                                       pole solution, which was reported in a previous work.

        Mainzer 2019                   The phase angle and PAB in the details record were computed
                                       using the mean JD given in the file. H-G are from MPCORB or
                                       custom MPC values. See the documentation in the PDS4

        Marsset 2017                   Marsset 2017 combined photometric, adaptive optics, and
                                       occultation data.

        Mainzer 2019                   The phase angle and PAB in the details record were computed

        Hanus 2013b                    Diameter is derived from AO-inversion model for preferred
                                       pole solution, which was reported in a previous work.

        Torppa 2003                    The sidereal period is believed incorrect (see Durech entry
                                       from DAMIT web site). The pole solution is still in close
                                       agreement with other solutions.

        Mainzer 2011                   The diameters and H values were taken from other sources and
                                       then used to calibrate expected errors in diameters and
                                       albedo derived from WISE data.

        Hanus 2013b                    Diameter is derived from occultation-inversion model for
                                       preferred pole solution, which was reported in a previous
                                       work.

        Colazo 2021d                   This applies to all Colazo 2021d entries. There are up to
                                       three details entries per object: 1) H-G using Gaia GR
                                       magnitudes, 2) H-G with GR magnitudes transformed to V and
                                       adding ground-based data to include phase angles < 10 deg,
                                       and 3) H-G1,G2 using the same magnitudes as in 2. Only
                                       results where there were valid numbers for H and HErr and the
                                       G or G1/G2 errors were <= 1.0 were included in the LCDB
                                       entries. H/HErr were rounded to two decimal places and G/GErr
                                       values were rounded to three decimal places. For a new
                                       summary record, the MPCOrb values are used for H and G for
                                       groups 1 and 3. This provides the necessary consitency for H
                                       when generating frequency-diameter plots from LCDB data,
                                       which have have been historically based on the H(V)-G system.
                                       For the Details record, the H Band is 'GR' for group 1 and
                                       'V' for groups 2 and 3. To help convey that the V magnitudes
                                       were derived from GR and assumed V-R magnitudes, the H Method
                                       is 'D' (Derived). The G Method will be empty for groups 1 and
                                       2 since, regardless

                                       entries. H/HErr were rounded to two decimal places and G/GErr
                                       values were rounded to three decimal places. For a new

        Durech 2011a                   Second pole solution (312,-42) gives a diameter of 443 ± 45
                                       km. This is not the preferred solution.

        Mahlke 2021                    The errors for H, G1, G2 are the larger of the HDI 95% values
                                       given for each parameter. In many cases, there are two
                                       entries for each asteroid, one for the c(yan) and the other
                                       for the o(range) ATLAS filter. The taxonomic class is on the
                                       Bus-DeMeo system was taken from various references. This work
                                       did not determine class independently.

        Mainzer 2011                   The diameters and H values were taken from other sources and
                                       then used to calibrate expected errors in diameters and

        Masiero 2017                   The albedo error given for Masiero 2017 is the maximum
                                       possible value when converting from albedo values from log
                                       space to value space.

        Martikainen 2021               This applies to all Martikainen 2021 entries (A 649, A98). Of
                                       the 492 asteroids in their tables, only 312 were included in
                                       the LCDB: those where H_G, G1, and G2 were found. They found
                                       that H_G and H_V had a strong 1:1 correlation, i.e., in
                                       almost all cases, the two values were essentially the same.
                                       For the Details records, the taxonomic class given by
                                       Martikainen et al. has a suffix of '(T)' (Tholen) or '(BDM)'
                                       Bus-DeMeo. The phase angle is the average of the min/max
                                       phase angles. The PAB values could not be computed. No errors
                                       were given for G1/G2. They have been assumed to be 0.05.
                                       Since the results are based in part on dense lightcurves, the
                                       Survey flag was set to LCI-D even though sparse Gaia data
                                       were included.

        Trilling 2010                  The Trilling (2010) results are based on using values for H
                                       taken from the JPL Horizons site. In Trilling (2010), there
                                       is often a significant disagreement among the albedo,
                                       diameter, and H values when they are applied to the standard
                                       formula that relates these three values (see LCDB README
                                       file), i.e., using the Trilling albedo and diameter values
                                       gives a differnt value for H than stated, sometimes by up to
                                       0.1 mag.

        Chang 2016                     Chang (2016) H values are based on H-G system. The G values
                                       are in R, not V. All lightcurves with a period were initially
                                       given U = 2 regardless of rating by Chang et al. The plots
                                       for the 352 lightcurves that did not have complete coverage
                                       were reviewed and the U codes revised. In many of those
                                       cases, it appears that the half-period was found. For those,
                                       if the summary line depended on the Chang et al. entry, the
                                       period on the summary line is double that found by Chang et
                                       al. and carries a 'D' (determined) flag in the NOTES field.

                                       In some cases, the precision of the period was considered too
                                       high and rounded to the nearest 0.1 h while in other cases,

        Chang (2016) H values are based on H-G system. The G values are in R, not V. All lightcurves
        with a period were initially given U = 2 regardless of rating by Chang et al. The plots for
        the 352 lightcurves that did not have complete coverage were reviewed and the U codes
        revised. In many of those cases, it appears that the half-period was found. For those, if
        the summary line depended on the Chang et al. entry, the period on the summary line is
        double that found by Chang et al. and carries a 'D' (determined) flag in the NOTES field. No
        errors were given for amplitudes, which were often dramatically overstated.

        Masiero 2020a                  This note applies to all entries for Masiero et al. (2020a).
                                       The albedo error is the listed maximum possible value when
                                       converting albedo values from log space to value space. The
                                       phase angle in the details record is from the file since the
                                       actual date of observation was not given. The value for H is
                                       the 'model-out' value, which may differ slightly from the
                                       value used in the NEATM modeling (the value given in Tables
                                       1-4). This maintains full agreement with the listed albedo
                                       and diameter. See Masiero et al. (2020a) for details about
                                       assumed errors in H and G.

        The errors for H, G1, G2 are the larger of the HDI 95% values given for each parameter. In
        many cases, there are two entries for each asteroid, one for the c(yan) and the other for
        the o(range) ATLAS filter. The taxonomic class is on the Bus-DeMeo system was taken from
        various references. This work did not determine class independently.

                                       Plan. Sci. J. 2, A162). The albedo error is the listed
                                       maximum possible value when converting albedo values from log
                                       space to value space. The phase angle in the details record
                                       is from the file since the actual date of observation was not
                                       given. The value for H is the 'model-out' value, which may
                                       differ slightly from the value used in the NEATM modeling
                                       (the value given in Tables 1-4). This maintains full
                                       agreement with the listed albedo and diameter. No specific
                                       errors for H and G were given. Default values of H_err = 0.05
                                       and G_err = 0.1 were used.

                                       There is slight evidence that the secondary may be tidally
                                       locked and, therefore, P2 is due to the rotation of a third

        This note applies to all Binzel 2019 (2019Icar..324...41B) detail records:  VIS indicates
        visible data only.  NIR indicates near-infrared data only.  VISNIR indicates both. eVISNIR
        indicates the visible portion of the spectrum is from the Eight-Color Asteroid Survey (ECAS,
        Zellner et al. 1985) sVis indicates the visible portion of the spectrum is from the Sloan
        Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, Ivezic et al. 2001). TAXON indicates the type is reported in the
        literature; see the source listed in the 'Taxon' reference column of the original file.  For
        visible data only (VIS), the taxonomic type is from the Bus classification system (Bus and
        Binzel 2002). For visible plus near-infrared data (VISNIR), the taxonomic type is from the
        Bus-DeMeo classification system (DeMeo et al. 2009).  '-comp' refers to the broad taxonomic
        complex. When multiple taxonomic classes are listed, they are in subjective order of most
        likely type first. ':' indicates the assignment is uncertain.

        This applies to all Colazo 2021d entries. There are up to three details entries per object:
        1) H-G using Gaia GR magnitudes, 2) H-G with GR magnitudes transformed to V and adding
        ground-based data to include phase angles < 10 deg, and 3) H-G1,G2 using the same magnitudes
        as in 2. Only results where there were valid numbers for H and HErr and the G or G1/G2
        errors were <= 1.0 were included in the LCDB entries. H/HErr were rounded to two decimal
        places and G/GErr values were rounded to three decimal places. For a new summary record, the
        MPCOrb values are used for H and G for groups 1 and 3. This provides the necessary
        consitency for H when generating frequency-diameter plots from LCDB data, which have have
        been historically based on the H(V)-G system. For the Details record, the H Band is 'GR' for
        group 1 and 'V' for groups 2 and 3. To help convey that the V magnitudes were derived from
        GR and assumed V-R magnitudes, the H Method is 'D' (Derived). The G Method will be empty for
        groups 1 and 2 since, regardless

                                       of tumbling. Both possibilties fit the data.

        Warner 2019p                   The split-halves plot for 5.16 h essentially duplicates the
                                       two halves. In this case, the shorter period was adopted.

                                       spectrum clearly favors 11.95 h or 23.9 h. The low amplitude
                                       and nearly Earth day period of the secondary lightcurve make
                                       a weak case for being binary.

        Behrend 2021web                Period was reported by Behrend as 9.130 h. However, that
                                       solution is based on only two nights and at significant phase
                                       angle, ~19 deg, while the 2010 curves from Cabognani and
                                       Owings are at a considerably lower phase angle, 5-6 deg. The
                                       latter, along with fairly large amplitude, would make a
                                       double period, quad extrema, curve very unlikely, bordering
                                       on impossible. On the other hand, the Behrend curve could be
                                       essentially monomodal, with just a very muted secondary
                                       maximum. Also troubling is the very sharp maxima of the
                                       Behrend fit. Sharp minima are expected and can be even more
                                       extreme due to shadowing, but very narrow maxima (broadside
                                       view) are much less expected.

        The Schierich (2009) results use previous lightcurve data to model the satellite:primary
        size ratio (D2/D1), pole of the orbital plane, and sidereal period of the orbit. The spin
        axis pole of the primary is considered to be the same as that of the orbit, i.e., the orbit
        lies in the primary's equatorial plane.

                                       in details records. The MPCORB H-G at the time of import are
                                       used in the summary line. The albedo error is the larger
                                       linear error listed in the table. The diameter is the
                                       corrected value (see Masiero et al. 2020b).

        Warner 2021a                   P2 is not a rotational alias of P1 and so the ambiguity lies
                                       in explaining the two periods. The low amplitudes and nearly
                                       the same periods precludes these being periods of a tumbler.

        This note applies to all entries for Masiero et al. (2020a). The albedo error is the listed
        maximum possible value when converting albedo values from log space to value space. The
        phase angle in the details record is from the file since the actual date of observation was
        not given. The value for H is the 'model-out' value, which may differ slightly from the
        value used in the NEATM modeling (the value given in Tables 1-4). This maintains full
        agreement with the listed albedo and diameter. See Masiero et al. (2020a) for details about
        assumed errors in H and G.

        The geocentric phase angle and PAB in the Masiero 2020b details records were computed using
        the mean MJD given in the file. H-G are the values used for the model and appear only in
        details records. The MPCORB H-G at the time of import are used in the summary line. The
        albedo error is the larger linear error listed in the table. The diameter is the corrected
        value (see Masiero et al. 2020b).

        Lacerda 2011                   The paper presumes a 'contact binary.' However, the
                                       lightcurves presented do not show the obvious indicators of
                                       'shoulders' in the descending and ascending branches. The
                                       lightcurve can be equally explained by a simple,
                                       highly-elongated body.

        Chang 2021                     This note applies to all Chang 2021 (PSJ 2) entries. The
                                       observations were made in g and r2 bands. The photometric
                                       bands (for H) were assigned as SG and SR, respectively. The
                                       H_SR values were transformed to approximate V by using the
                                       LCDB V = SR+ 0.22. While not exact, this makes the values
                                       more compatible to H_V when plotting frequency-diameters. For
                                       diameter calculations, an albedo of 0.05 and G = 0.15 Â± 0.2

                                       values were assumed to be the same as for an identified
                                       object in the same observing block. The entries are flagged
                                       as being from a Sparse Wide-field Survey (SWF).

        Rondon 2022                    The observation date is the first in the set of observations,
                                       which spanned more than a year. The phase angle range was
                                       45.2-97.3 deg. The H_SR values are the linear extrapolation
                                       using the phase slope (beta_SR) of 0.03584. The lack of low
                                       phase angles prevented use of H-G or HG1,G2 modeling.

        The Schierich (2009) results use previous lightcurve data to model the satellite:primary
        size ratio (D2/D1), pole of the orbital plane, and sidereal period of the orbit. The spin
        axis pole of the primary is considered to be the same as that of the orbit, i.e., the orbit
        lies in the primary's equatorial plane.

                                       period. The long period is attributed to the primary body
                                       while the short period is presumed to be due to the rotation
                                       of the fully asynchronous satellite.

        Warner 2010e                   The short period, low amplitude component of the lightcurve
                                       may be due to a widely separated component of a binary that
                                       is a relatively small and irregularly shaped, or a larger but
                                       more regularly shaped body.   If a binary, the period of the
                                       orbit cannot be determined from the observations but is
                                       probably long based on the absence of mutual events and
                                       asynchronous rotation of the two components.  The
                                       low-amplitude component of the lightcurve is U = 1/1+. This
                                       applies not only to the quality of the solution for the
                                       component but to the probability of the asteroid being binary
                                       as well.

        This note applies to all entries for Masiero et al. (2021; Plan. Sci. J. 2, A162). The
        albedo error is the listed maximum possible value when converting albedo values from log
        space to value space. The phase angle in the details record is from the file since the
        actual date of observation was not given. The value for H is the 'model-out' value, which
        may differ slightly from the value used in the NEATM modeling (the value given in Tables
        1-4). This maintains full agreement with the listed albedo and diameter. No specific errors
        for H and G were given. Default values of H_err = 0.05 and G_err = 0.1 were used.

        Benner (2006a) observed with radar and found a dimension of at least 1.2 km based on echo
        delay range. However, the images indicate the possibility of a bifurcated body with an
        effective diameter of about 1.5 km. Based on the total information, we presumed a dark
        (C-type) asteroid and used the default albedo for that class and MPCORB H to derive a
        diameter.

        This note applies to all Lo et al. (2020, AJ 159) entries. A suffix of 'Lo21-' has been
        added to the all-numeric internal IDs used by Lo et al. to avoid confusion with an
        MPC-assigned number. The astrometric data they provided was used to match each of their
        objects to one in the MPCOrb data set. In most cases, the cross-match was unambiguous. For
        the others, there will be an entry in the extended notes for that particular Lo et al.
        details record. This is particularly important for objects in the summary line that have
        only the Lo et al. reference and are flagged as uncertain. Here, the object listed may not
        be the correct one. The Date, PAB_L, PAB_B, and Phase entries in the details record are
        based on 1) the cross-matched ID and 2) the first date of observations, which usually
        spanned about three days.

        This note applies to all Chang 2021 (PSJ 2) entries. The observations were made in g and r2
        bands. The photometric bands (for H) were assigned as SG and SR, respectively. The H_SR
        values were transformed to approximate V by using the LCDB V = SR+ 0.22. While not exact,
        this makes the values more compatible to H_V when plotting frequency-diameters. For diameter
        calculations, an albedo of 0.05 and G = 0.15 Â± 0.2 was assumed for both bands. Only some of
        the 53 objects could be tied to an object in the MPC database. For those without ID, and
        where possible, the phase and phase angle bisector values were assumed to be the same as for
        an identified object in the same observing block. The entries are flagged as being from a
        Sparse Wide-field Survey (SWF).
